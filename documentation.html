                <p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
                <p>Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.</p>
                <p>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
                    <li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
                    <li>OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
                    <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>

            <p>When you define a class, you define a blueprint for a data type. This doesn't actually define any data, but it does define what the class name means, that is, what an object of the class will consist of and what operations can be performed on such an object.</p>
            <p>A class definition starts with the keyword class followed by the class name; and the class body, enclosed by a pair of curly braces. A class definition must be followed either by a semicolon or a list of declarations. For example, we defined the Box data type using the keyword class as follows −</p>
            <code class="code">
                <pre>
                    class Box {
                        public:
                           double length;   // Length of a box
                           double breadth;  // Breadth of a box
                           double height;   // Height of a box
                     };</pre>
            </code>
            <p>The keyword public determines the access attributes of the members of the class that follows it. A public member can be accessed from outside the class anywhere within the scope of the class object. You can also specify the members of a class as private or protected which we will discuss in a sub-section.</p>

                <ol class="a">
                    <li><h4>Class Member Functions</h4><p>A member function of a class is a function that has its definition or its prototype within the class definition like any other variable.</p></li>
                    <li><h4>Class Access Modifiers</h4><p>A class member can be defined as public, private or protected. By default members would be assumed as private.</p></li>
                    <li><h4>Constructor & Destructor</h4><p>A class constructor is a special function in a class that is called when a new object of the class is created. A destructor is also a special function which is called when created object is deleted.</p></li>
                    <li><h4>Copy Constructor</h4><p>The copy constructor is a constructor which creates an object by initializing it with an object of the same class, which has been created previously.</p></li>
                    <li><h4>Friend Functions</h4><p>A friend function is permitted full access to private and protected members of a class.</p></li>
                    <li><h4>Inline Functions</h4><p>With an inline function, the compiler tries to expand the code in the body of the function in place of a call to the function.</p></li>
                    <li><h4>this Pointer</h4><p>Every object has a special pointer this which points to the object itself.</p></li>
                    <li><h4>Pointer to C++ Classes</h4><p>A pointer to a class is done exactly the same way a pointer to a structure is. In fact a class is really just a structure with functions in it.</p></li>
                    <li><h4>Static Members of a Class</h4><p>Both data members and function members of a class can be declared as static.</p></li>

                <h1>Inheritance</h1>
            </header>
            <p>One of the most important concepts in object-oriented programming is that of inheritance. Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class, which makes it easier to create and maintain an application. This also provides an opportunity to reuse the code functionality and fast implementation time.</p>
            <p>When creating a class, instead of writing completely new data members and member functions, the programmer can designate that the new class should inherit the members of an existing class. This existing class is called the <strong>base</strong> class, and the new class is referred to as the <strong>derived</strong> class.</p>
            <p>The idea of inheritance implements the is a relationship. For example, mammal IS-A animal, dog IS-A mammal hence dog IS-A animal as well and so on.</p>
            <header class="main-section-header">
                <h1>Base and Derived Classes</h1>
            </header>
            <p>A class can be derived from more than one classes, which means it can inherit data and functions from multiple base classes. To define a derived class, we use a class derivation list to specify the base class(es). A class derivation list names one or more base classes and has the form −</p>
            <code class="code">
                <pre>
                    class derived-class: access-specifier base-class</pre>
            </code>
            <p>Where access-specifier is one of public, protected, or private, and base-class is the name of a previously defined class. If the access-specifier is not used, then it is private by default.</p>

            <p>C++ allows you to specify more than one definition for a function name or an operator in the same scope, which is called function overloading and operator overloading respectively.</p>
            <p>An overloaded declaration is a declaration that is declared with the same name as a previously declared declaration in the same scope, except that both declarations have different arguments and obviously different definition (implementation).</p>
            <p>When you call an overloaded function or operator, the compiler determines the most appropriate definition to use, by comparing the argument types you have used to call the function or operator with the parameter types specified in the definitions. The process of selecting the most appropriate overloaded function or operator is called overload resolution.</p>

            <p>You can redefine or overload most of the built-in operators available in C++. Thus, a programmer can use operators with user-defined types as well.</p>
            <p>Overloaded operators are functions with special names: the keyword "operator" followed by the symbol for the operator being defined. Like any other function, an overloaded operator has a return type and a parameter list.</p>

            <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −</p>

            <p>The reason for the incorrect output is that the call of the function area() is being set once by the compiler as the version defined in the base class. This is called static resolution of the function call, or static linkage - the function call is fixed before the program is executed. This is also sometimes called early binding because the area() function is set during the compilation of the program.</p>
            <p>But now, let's make a slight modification in our program and precede the declaration of area() in the Shape class with the keyword virtual so that it looks like this −</p>
            <code class="code">
                <pre>
                    class Shape {

                           Shape( int a = 0, int b = 0) {
                              width = a;
                              height = b;
                           }
                           virtual int area() {
                              cout &lt;&lt; "Parent class area :" &lt;&lt; endl;
                              return 0;
                           }
                     };</pre>
            </code>
            <p>After this slight modification, when the previous example code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −</p>
            <code class="code">
                <pre>

                    Triangle class area</pre>
            </code>
            <p>This time, the compiler looks at the contents of the pointer instead of it's type. Hence, since addresses of objects of tri and rec classes are stored in *shape the respective area() function is called.</p>
            <p>As you can see, each of the child classes has a separate implementation for the function area(). This is how <strong>polymorphism</strong> is generally used. You have different classes with a function of the same name, and even the same parameters, but with different implementations.</p>

            <p>A virtual function is a function in a base class that is declared using the keyword virtual. Defining in a base class a virtual function, with another version in a derived class, signals to the compiler that we don't want static linkage for this function.</p>
            <p>What we do want is the selection of the function to be called at any given point in the program to be based on the kind of object for which it is called. This sort of operation is referred to as dynamic linkage, or late binding.</p>

                <h1>Data Abstraction in C++</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details, i.e., to represent the needed information in program without presenting the details.</p>
            <p>Data abstraction is a programming (and design) technique that relies on the separation of interface and implementation.</p>
            <p>Let's take one real life example of a TV, which you can turn on and off, change the channel, adjust the volume, and add external components such as speakers, VCRs, and DVD players, BUT you do not know its internal details, that is, you do not know how it receives signals over the air or through a cable, how it translates them, and finally displays them on the screen.</p>
            <p>Thus, we can say a television clearly separates its internal implementation from its external interface and you can play with its interfaces like the power button, channel changer, and volume control without having any knowledge of its internals.</p>
            <p>In C++, classes provides great level of data abstraction. They provide sufficient public methods to the outside world to play with the functionality of the object and to manipulate object data, i.e., state without actually knowing how class has been implemented internally.</p>
            <p>For example, your program can make a call to the sort() function without knowing what algorithm the function actually uses to sort the given values. In fact, the underlying implementation of the sorting functionality could change between releases of the library, and as long as the interface stays the same, your function call will still work.</p>
            <p>In C++, we use <strong>classes</strong> to define our own abstract data types (ADT). You can use the <strong>cout</strong> object of class <strong>ostream</strong> to stream data to standard output like this −</p>
            <code class="code">

                    }</pre>
            </code>
            <p>Here, you don't need to understand how cout displays the text on the user's screen. You need to only know the public interface and the underlying implementation of ‘cout’ is free to change.</p>

                <h1>Access Labels Enforce Abstraction</h1>
            </header>
            <p>In C++, we use access labels to define the abstract interface to the class. A class may contain zero or more access labels −</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Members defined with a public label are accessible to all parts of the program. The data-abstraction view of a type is defined by its public members.</li>
                <li>Members defined with a private label are not accessible to code that uses the class. The private sections hide the implementation from code that uses the type.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are no restrictions on how often an access label may appear. Each access label specifies the access level of the succeeding member definitions. The specified access level remains in effect until the next access label is encountered or the closing right brace of the class body is seen.</p>
            <header class="main-section-header">
                <h1>Benefits of Data Abstraction</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Data abstraction provides two important advantages −</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Class internals are protected from inadvertent user-level errors, which might corrupt the state of the object.</li>
                <li>The class implementation may evolve over time in response to changing requirements or bug reports without requiring change in user-level code.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By defining data members only in the private section of the class, the class author is free to make changes in the data. If the implementation changes, only the class code needs to be examined to see what affect the change may have. If data is public, then any function that directly access the data members of the old representation might be broken.</p>

                <h1>Data Encapsulation in C++</h1>
            </header>
            <p>All C++ programs are composed of the following two fundamental elements −</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Program statements (code)</strong> − This is the part of a program that performs actions and they are called functions.</li>
                <li><strong>Program data</strong> − The data is the information of the program which gets affected by the program functions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of <strong>data hiding</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Data encapsulation</strong> is a mechanism of bundling the data, and the functions that use them and data abstraction is a mechanism of exposing only the interfaces and hiding the implementation details from the user.</p>
            <p>C++ supports the properties of encapsulation and data hiding through the creation of user-defined types, called classes. We already have studied that a class can contain private, protected and public members. By default, all items defined in a class are private. For example −</p>
            <code class="code">
                <pre>
                    class Box {
                        public:
                           double getVolume(void) {
                              return length * breadth * height;
                           }
                     
                        private:
                           double length;      // Length of a box
                           double breadth;     // Breadth of a box
                           double height;      // Height of a box
                     };</pre>
            </code>
            <p>The variables length, breadth, and height are private. This means that they can be accessed only by other members of the Box class, and not by any other part of your program. This is one way encapsulation is achieved.</p>
            <p>To make parts of a class public (i.e., accessible to other parts of your program), you must declare them after the public keyword. All variables or functions defined after the public specifier are accessible by all other functions in your program.</p>
            <p>Making one class a friend of another exposes the implementation details and reduces encapsulation. The ideal is to keep as many of the details of each class hidden from all other classes as possible.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Any C++ program where you implement a class with public and private members is an example of data encapsulation and data abstraction. Consider the following example −</p>
            <code class="code">
                <pre>

                                 total = i;
                              }
                              
                              // interface to outside world
                              void addNum(int number) {
                                 total += number;
                              }

                              };
                           
                           private:
                              // hidden data from outside world
                              int total;
                        };
                        
                        int main() {
                           Adder a;
                           
                           a.addNum(10);
                           a.addNum(20);
                           a.addNum(30);

            <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −</p>
            <code class="code">
                <pre>
                    Total 60</pre>
            </code>
            <p>Above class adds numbers together, and returns the sum. The public members addNum and getTotal are the interfaces to the outside world and a user needs to know them to use the class. The private member total is something that is hidden from the outside world, but is needed for the class to operate properly.</p>

            <p>Most of us have learnt to make class members private by default unless we really need to expose them. That's just good encapsulation.</p>
            <p>This is applied most frequently to data members, but it applies equally to all members, including virtual functions.</p>

                <h1>Interfaces</h1>
            </header>
            <p>An interface describes the behavior or capabilities of a C++ class without committing to a particular implementation of that class.</p>
            <p>The C++ interfaces are implemented using abstract classes and these abstract classes should not be confused with data abstraction which is a concept of keeping implementation details separate from associated data.</p>
            <p>A class is made abstract by declaring at least one of its functions as pure virtual function. A pure virtual function is specified by placing "= 0" in its declaration as follows −</p>
            <code class="code">
                <pre>
                    class Box {
                        public:
                           // pure virtual function
                           virtual double getVolume() = 0;
                           
                        private:
                           double length;      // Length of a box
                           double breadth;     // Breadth of a box
                           double height;      // Height of a box
                     };</pre>
            </code>
            <p>The purpose of an abstract class (often referred to as an ABC) is to provide an appropriate base class from which other classes can inherit. Abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects and serves only as an interface. Attempting to instantiate an object of an abstract class causes a compilation error.</p>
            <p>Thus, if a subclass of an ABC needs to be instantiated, it has to implement each of the virtual functions, which means that it supports the interface declared by the ABC. Failure to override a pure virtual function in a derived class, then attempting to instantiate objects of that class, is a compilation error.</p>
            <p>Classes that can be used to instantiate objects are called concrete classes.</p>

            <p>An object-oriented system might use an abstract base class to provide a common and standardized interface appropriate for all the external applications. Then, through inheritance from that abstract base class, derived classes are formed that operate similarly.</p>
            <p>The capabilities (i.e., the public functions) offered by the external applications are provided as pure virtual functions in the abstract base class. The implementations of these pure virtual functions are provided in the derived classes that correspond to the specific types of the application.</p>
            <p>This architecture also allows new applications to be added to a system easily, even after the system has been defined.</p>
